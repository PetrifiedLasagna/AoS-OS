Thank you for choosing the Visual C++ Toolkit!

Use the free Visual C++ Toolkit to build your ISO C++ Standard code, to evaluate new compiler features, and to get a feel for some of the capabilities included with Visual Studio .NET 2003.    The tools and libraries included with the Toolkit are a subset of the features and capabilities of Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional.  Buy Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional and get a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE), an award-winning debugger, additional C++ libraries including ATL and MFC, and much more.

What’s Included, and What’s Not Included

The Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 is a free download and does not include customer support or specific documentation.  Please refer to documentation for the Visual C++ compiler and libraries online at:  
 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vcedit/html/vcorivisualcmainnode.asp
 
Please refer to the End User License Agreement (EULA.TXT) and Redistributable File List (REDIST.TXT) for complete licensing information.  In general, applications and components built using the Visual C++ Toolkit may be redistributed without restriction.
 
The Visual C++ Toolkit includes the core tools and libraries necessary to build basic C++ applications and programs:
 
1. Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler and Linker.  These are the same compiler and linker that ship with Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional!
 
2. C Runtime Library and the C++ Standard Library, including the Standard Template Library.  These are the same static-link libraries included with Visual Studio.  Visual Studio also ships these libraries in dynamic-link versions, and with full source code.
 
3. Microsoft .NET Framework Common Language Runtime.  Visual C++ can optionally build applications that run on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).  
 
4. Sample code.  The toolkit includes four samples designed to showcase the powerful new features of the 2003 version, including new optimization capabilities, features to improve code-security and robustness, enhanced ISO C++ standards support, and the ability to use the .NET Framework library and target the CLR.
 
The Visual C++ Toolkit does not include several core features found in Visual Studio .NET 2003.  
 
1. Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  The Visual Studio IDE incorporates multitudes of developer tools including code editors, the Visual Studio debugger, and a project system.   Learn more about Visual Studio at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio.
 
2. Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) and Active Template Libraries (ATL).  These robust and mature libraries provide C++ developers with encapsulated functionality for building Windows-based applications.   In Visual Studio these are provided with complete source code.
 
3. Advanced developer tools, including compilers and tools for developing using other languages like Visual Basic and C#.  Visual Studio provides developers with a complete toolset for building all types of applications and components for Windows and .NET.
 
Using the Visual C++ Toolkit
 
The Visual C++ Toolkit installs the “Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 Command Prompt” into the Start Menu.  This command-shell window is configured to enable compilation and linking of C++ programs using the toolkit-provided tools.  
 
A batch file (vcvars32.bat) in the Toolkit installation directory sets the environment variables (PATH, INCLUDE, LIB) to point at Toolkit directories.  Execute this batch file from any command prompt to configure for compilation using the Toolkit compiler.
 
There are four samples included with the Toolkit, located in the Samples subdirectory.  These short samples showcase new or updated capabilities of the Visual C++ compiler.  Each sample includes a short whitepaper explaining the sample, and one or more batch files that can be used to compile the sample code.  
 
Next Steps
 
Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the Visual C++ compiler and the samples included with the Toolkit, you’re ready to build!  You can use the Toolkit to build a variety of C++-based programs, using core C++ libraries and the .NET Framework.  If you like, you can augment the toolkit with additional free developer tools and resources.  For example, you can download any of the following:
 
* Microsoft Platform SDK.  This Software Developer Kit provides extensive headers and libraries for building Win32-based applications.  And it includes additional developer tools as well!  http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/
 
* Microsoft .NET Framework SDK Version 1.1.  The Visual C++ Toolkit installs a subset of the full .NET Framework SDK.  Install the full SDK to gain access to documentation and additional tools. http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D&displaylang=en
 
* DirectX 9.0 SDK.  Install the DirectX 9 SDK and get started building cool software with full 3D rendering capabilities.  Lots of samples are included. http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1d97f320-9dfd-4e7a-b947-3a037ccf84af&displaylang=en
 
If you have any questions about the C++ programming, or the Toolkit itself, we highly recommend visiting a C++ newsgroup or community site.  The free Toolkit does not include technical support, but many questions about Visual C++ are answered online.  Start by checking the Visual C++ FAQ:

When you’re ready, we suggest you check out Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional, which includes lots of additional functionality for C++ developers, including an award-winning IDE and code debugger, additional libraries, and much more!  You can try out Visual Studio for free, online.  Visit http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/tryit/ for more information.
 
Uninstalling the Visual C++ Toolkit
 
Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in the Windows Control Panel to uninstall the Visual C++ Toolkit.  
 
The Toolkit installs the ‘Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1’ if it is not previously installed.  The uninstaller does not remove this shared component, but it may be removed manually using the Add/Remove Programs tool. 
 
Version Updates

Version 1.01

* Updated the bin and lib directories with the exact files that ship in Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional.  In the initial 1.0 release, these files differed only by the build number, not in functionality. 
* Updated the white paper for the Optimization sample to reference “Athlon64” as opposed to “Athlon”, where appropriate.
* Corrected a typographical error in the welcome text of the command prompt
* Added this version update section
