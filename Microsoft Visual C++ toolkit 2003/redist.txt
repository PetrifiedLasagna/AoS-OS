There are no redistributable files (i.e., dll's/cab's, etc.) included with the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003. Object library files included with the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 (e.g. the C Runtime Library static libraries designated with the suffix ".lib") will be automatically linked to your program when they are compiled by the Visual C++ compiler and linker.  Inclusion of these static libraries as compiled into your program is acceptable; you may not, however, redistribute the static libraries standalone - on their own.
