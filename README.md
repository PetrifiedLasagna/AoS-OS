======== General ========

This is the development repository for Ace of Spades - Open Source. All contributions that are made must bring this project closer to the goal of becoming a near mirror of Ace of Spades 0.75 and then 0.76. If this goal is reached and even surpassed then I hope that AoS-OS will be considered the latest version.

=======Contributing======

For those willing to contribute I will be including a default workspace so that it is possible to compile and make changes to the 'current' version of all the files. Also you are not to remove any credits from the top of files or that will be outputted to the window of the application.

Please read the README in default workspace for further instructions.

========Licenense========

in addition to the license that comes with the voxlap source code, those who wish to modify any of the code in this repository and distribute elsewhere must leave a link to this repository.
