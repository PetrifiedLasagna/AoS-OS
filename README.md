======== General ========

This is the development repository for Ace of Spades - Open Source. All contributions that are made must bring this project closer to the goal of becoming a near mirror of Ace of Spades 0.75 and then 0.76. If this goal is reached and even surpassed then I hope that AoS-OS will be considered the latest version.

=======Contributing======

For those willing to contribute I will be including a default workspace so that it is possible to compile and make changes to the 'current' version of all the files. Also you are not to remove any credits from the top of files or that will be outputted to the window of the application.

everything I use to compile is inside default workspace including:

microsoft visual c/c++ toolkit 2003

Direct X SDK

Voxlap unmodified source code

This does not include the masm32 assembler which is needed to make changes to v5.asm. You can download it from here http://www.masm32.com/masmdl.htm

after that all you need to do is change setup.bat and vcvars32.bat to match you paths and you can compile by running makestuf.bat or the command nmake [file]

========Licenense========

in addition to the license that comes with the voxlap source code, those who wish to modify any of the code in this repository and distribute elsewhere must leave a link to this repository.

Also those who wish to contribute must compile and test your changes on the >LATEST< source before adding the changes to the repository
