You must download all the latest files from the src folder located in the root to have an up to date workspace. All the source files in this folder have not been modified in any way and it is required to have the latest files if you wish to contribute.

everything I use to compile is inside default workspace including:

microsoft visual c/c++ toolkit 2003

Direct X SDK

Voxlap unmodified source code

This does not include the masm32 assembler which is needed to make changes to v5.asm. You can download it from here http://www.masm32.com/masmdl.htm

You can compile your code by running makestuf.bat or the command nmake [file].

Before attempting to compile make sure that setup.bat and vcars.bat point to the correct locations. Once your code is ready just do a pull request and it will be verified. Do not send me messages saying that the workspace does not work because I myself use this to compile so it is WORKING.
